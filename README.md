# Info Retrieve
## A rule-based data capture system.
TEAM: SC-001871

**Runners-Up** - Techfest Springfield Challenge 

## Introduction

Data capture is a method which organizations can use to consolidate their large pools of
data into a structured and meaningful form. However, traditional methods such as manual
data entry can be costly and time consuming.
Hence, we propose an automated system for rule-based data capture, which not only
classifies and captures data from documents based on the rules, but will also be able to
learn from the various rules and classify unknown documents to specific classes and extract
information from them.

## Running it
Use any favourite IDE for Java and import the project as a Maven project, Maven should be able to build your project. 
Just run the Main method and you are good to go. :')

Using Embedded TomCat Server.
